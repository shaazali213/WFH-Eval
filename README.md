# WFH-Eval
Evaluated a travel agency’s work-from-home pilot by merging employee performance, status, characteristics, and quit data into panel datasets and applying fixed-effects DiD analysis to estimate the causal impacts on productivity and retention.

For this project, I first created an STPR project in Stata where I could put all the different files provided to stay organized. I loaded all the files to get a feel for each, along with the overarching task. This took about a day of just looking through everything to understand the nuances of the data. I used commands like describe, codebook, and summarize to see all the necessary info to give me a good idea of what to do/use.
After this, I focused my analysis on 4 key datasets that best help me in answering the company's questions about productivity and retention:
EmployeeStatus.dta - This dataset was essential as it provides the main treatment assignment, which defines the comparison groups for causal inference. It contains one row per employee with the dummy treatment variable, which is the assignment variable. This is crucial just to know who is in what group.
Performance_Panel.dta - I selected this dataset because it offers the most data to observe productivity before and after the test. This will allow me to test performance differences between groups once combined with the status table.
QuitDate.dta - This dataset analyzes employee retention. It is structured in monthly panel form, similar to Performance_Panel, making it good for modeling quitting behavior over time.
EmployeeCharacteristics.dta - This data set was added to improve precision and verify randomization balance since it contains personal information on each employee assigned to the pilot.
These tables provided the baseline for me to decide what type of analysis I wanted to do. But to have all the information to conduct analysis, I created primary objectives that would let me answer the project question. These were:
Obtaining a clear causal estimate of the effect of working from home on productivity
Determining if working from home reduces employee turnover
Validating my analysis with logical explanations
Now to implement the above, I applied these strategies to form tables and figures. I used difference-in-differences with worker fixed effects as my primary strategy. This approach was picked because it allows me to identify the causal impact of the work-from-home policy by comparing changes in outcomes between the treatment and control groups before and after the policy implementation. Since there is random assignment to treatment and control groups in this study we can say there is no difference in the groups except for whether they work from home or in person, showing a potential causal effect. In addition to the core DiD model, I constructed a separate quit panel to track employee attrition and assess how work-from-home status influenced quitting behavior. Finally, for my figure, I included a time series line graph that plots average productivity by control and treatment across periods. This later helps me with logical validations.
Next, now having my objectives and approaches figured out, I created two consolidated datasets through merging:
Main Table (MainTab.dta): I merged Performance_Panel with EmployeeStatus and EmployeeCharacteristics using a many-to-one approach. This was used because each employee has multiple observations in the performance panel (one per month), but only one entry in the status and characteristics files. I then made variables to mark the treatment period (after), the interaction term (treatAfter), and time formatting variables for analysis and visualization.
Quit Table (QuitTab.dta): I merged the main table with QuitDate.dta using a one-to-one merge based on person ID and time. This allowed me to track both productivity and quit behavior in the same timeframe. After merging, I removed rows that only existed in the quit data and didn’t have corresponding performance or treatment information. These quit only rows have missing key variables that would break the regression logic. I also replaced missing quit values with 0 to show that those employees did not quit that month, as supported by the other columns. Finally, I dropped the stillworking variable since the variable quit fully captured each person’s employment status.
For my regression specifications, I implemented fixed-effects models. These models are better than regular difference by difference because you can control for unobserved time-invariant individual characteristics. 
The xtreg regressions I ran included:
The dependent variable (calls per hour or quit probability) for individual in time 
Interaction term
Dummy for after the policy
Fixed‑effects option
Clustered standard errors
I clustered standard errors at the individual level (learned concept on stackexchange) to account for correlation across months for the same employee. This isolates the causal effect of working from home by comparing each employee to themselves over time.

Section 3: Findings and Recommendations
My analysis of the work-from-home program shows strong evidence that the company should expand the policy to the full workforce. The main two metrics based on the assignment that I used were positive impacts on both productivity and employee retention.
To first discuss the impact on productivity, Table 1 presents the difference-in-differences regression results on productivity. The coefficient on “Treatment After Period” (0.444) is positive and statistically significant at the 1% level (p < 0.01). This shows that employees in the work from home group experienced an average increase of 0.444 more calls per hour compared to the control group after the policy implementation. This is about a 2.2% increase in productivity relative to the pre-treatment average. The “Both After Period” coefficient (0.292) is positive and significant at the 5% level. This shows a general improvement in productivity over time across all employees. However, the treatment effect is still substantial even after seeing the general time trend.
The productivity gains are also shown and confirmed in Figure 1, which shows the monthly average calls per hour for both groups over time. The figure demonstrates reasonably parallel trends before the intervention, which confirms a main assumption of DiD. While there is some variation in the pre-treatment period, the randomization also helps add to this assumption.
Also, I think during the first few months of implementation, the treatment group shows some adjustment as employees adapt to working from home. In my opinion, this initial adaptation period is expected as workers develop new routines and strategies for remote work. By late 2011, approximately 6-8 months into the program, the treatment group consistently outperformed the control group in productivity. And this gap only gets larger toward the end of the observation period.
Next, with impact on employee retention, Table 2 presents the difference-in-differences results on monthly quit probability. The coefficient on “Treatment After Period” (-0.037) is negative and significant at the 1% level (p < 0.01). This shows that work-from-home employees were 3.7 percent less likely to quit in any given month compared to the control group. This represents a substantial reduction in turnover. The “Both After Period” coefficient shows a general trend in quit behavior across both groups, but the treatment effect remains strong after accounting for this. This finding strongly supports the company's initial concern that long commutes were driving employees to leave, and allowing remote work significantly improved retention.
Based on these findings, I recommend expanding the work-from-home policy to the full workforce. The data clearly shows that work from home arrangements lead to increased productivity after an initial adjustment period, with sustained improvements over time. Additionally, remote work substantially reduces monthly quit probability, which addresses the company's retention concerns. There will be some initial adjustment costs as employees adapt to remote work environments, however, the data shows these are temporary, with performance improving over time. The company may want to provide additional support during the transition period to help employees adapt to home office setups.
